# Genetic Algorithm
## About
I started this project in 2018 after watching a [video from Fullstack Academy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP8R0yzAbdo&t=71s) detailing how genetic algorithms work. I had been dabbling in machine learning found this crossover of evolution and machine learning fascinating. Since then, I've been working on my own genetic algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem. In 2020, I was inspired by The Coding Train's [introductory video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zfeTw-uFCw) to first make a genetic algorithm based off the Shakespearean Monkey thought experiment. I found this problem easier to solve and a good stepping stone towards the traveling salesman problem. Without ever refrencing his or anyone else's code, I was able to implement my own algorithm to solve this problem. Next, I hope to finally write an algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem!
